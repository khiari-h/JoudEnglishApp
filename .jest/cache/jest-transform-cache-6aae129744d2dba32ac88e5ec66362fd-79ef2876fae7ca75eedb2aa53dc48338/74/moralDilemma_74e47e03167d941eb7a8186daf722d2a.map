Cultural factors significantly influence these considerations: in some societies, family obligation might be seen as the highest moral duty, potentially justifying actions taken to protect family members, while in others, adherence to abstract principles like truthfulness might take precedence regardless of circumstances.

I believe the most defensible ethical reasoning acknowledges both dimensions: upholding fundamental principles like honesty and integrity while recognizing that their application requires thoughtful consideration of circumstances.

To those suggesting my approach is too rigid, I would emphasize that contextual flexibility without firm principles becomes moral relativism, where any action can be justified through circumstantial reasoning. The most robust ethical approaches maintain clear principles while acknowledging that their application requires judgment informed by relevant circumstances, just as legal systems distinguish between identical actions performed under different conditions.

Principles matter precisely because they guide us through complex situations, not because they absolve us from the responsibility of careful moral reasoning. To those viewing my approach as too rigid, I would clarify that contextual consideration doesn't mean subjective preference—not all reasons carry equal moral weight, and some principles (like truth-telling in professional contexts) establish strong presumptions that require substantial justification to override. Ethical reasoning is neither mechanical rule-application nor subjective preference, but rather a disciplined practice of applying principles within contexts.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The author acknowledges the restaurant's visual appeal ('undeniably beautiful') while being aware it's designed for social media, showing appreciation but not naivety about the marketing intent."

    options: ["The food quality didn't match the premium pricing", "The service was slow and poorly managed", "The restaurant prioritizes image over substance", "The reservation system is difficult to navigate"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "While the author mentions food quality and service issues, their conclusion focuses on the restaurant being 'more concerned with looking good on social media than actually delivering a memorable dining experience.'"

  }, {
    id: "q002_04",
    text: "How does the author's mention of other tables getting served first function in the review?",

  questions: [{
    id: "q003_01",
    text: "What does the author's initial spending breakdown (65% needs, 40% wants = 105%) reveal about their financial situation?",
    options: ["They were bad at math and tracking expenses", "They were living beyond their means and possibly using credit", "They had irregular income that made budgeting difficult", "They were including shared expenses in their calculations"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Spending 105% of income indicates the author was spending more than they earned, likely through credit cards or savings, which explains why the 20% savings goal 'felt impossible.'"

    text: "How did the 50/30/20 rule function as a tool for the author?",
    options: ["It provided a perfect formula they could follow exactly", "It created awareness that led to better spending habits", "It was too restrictive and caused financial stress", "It helped them save money but didn't change their mindset"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The author emphasizes that 'the awareness alone cut my spending by about 15%' and that it 'forced me to confront uncomfortable truths,' showing it was valuable for building consciousness rather than as a rigid formula."

    text: "Based on the author's experience, what's their view on rigid budgeting rules?",
    options: ["They work perfectly when followed exactly as designed", "They're useful frameworks but need personal adaptation", "They're too simplistic for real-world financial situations", "They create guilt and stress without providing benefits"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The author concludes that 'The 50/30/20 rule isn't magic, and it won't work for everyone exactly as advertised. But it's a useful framework' and emphasizes learning 'habits and awareness' over 'perfect percentages.'"
  }, {
    id: "q003_05",
    text: "What does the author mean by 'color-coding spreadsheets' in the context of their story?",
    options: ["A specific budgeting app feature they discovered", "A metaphor for their obsessive tracking behavior", "An accounting method their financial advisor recommended", "A way to separate business and personal expenses"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The repeated mention of 'color-coded spreadsheets' represents the author's initially obsessive approach to tracking, which they later move away from while keeping the valuable habits they learned."

    correctAnswer: 1,

    options: ["Learning to use simpler tools and systems", "Losing the social community around productivity culture", "Trusting their own judgment without data feedback", "Explaining their decision to friends and family"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "The author states 'Without constant data feedback, I felt anxious and unmoored' and 'It took weeks to trust my own judgment,' showing the difficulty of moving from external validation to internal confidence."

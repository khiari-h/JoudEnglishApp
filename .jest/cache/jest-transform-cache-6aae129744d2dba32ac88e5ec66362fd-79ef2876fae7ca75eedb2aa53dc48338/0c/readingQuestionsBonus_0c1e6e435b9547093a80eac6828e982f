    text: "What does the author's initial spending breakdown (65% needs, 40% wants = 105%) reveal about their financial situation?",

    correctAnswer: 1,

    options: ["They work perfectly when followed exactly as designed", "They're useful frameworks but need personal adaptation", "They're too simplistic for real-world financial situations", "They create guilt and stress without providing benefits"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The author concludes that 'The 50/30/20 rule isn't magic, and it won't work for everyone exactly as advertised. But it's a useful framework' and emphasizes learning 'habits and awareness' over 'perfect percentages.'"
  }, {
    id: "q003_05",

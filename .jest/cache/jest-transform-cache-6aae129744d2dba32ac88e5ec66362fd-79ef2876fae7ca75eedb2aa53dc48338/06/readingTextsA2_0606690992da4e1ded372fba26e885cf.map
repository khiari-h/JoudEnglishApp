They left London early on Saturday morning by train. The journey took about one hour. When they arrived, the weather was perfect - sunny but not too hot. They walked along the famous pier and took many photos. For lunch, they ate fish and chips at a traditional restaurant near the beach. In the afternoon, they visited the Royal Pavilion, a magnificent palace with Indian-style architecture. Jenny bought some postcards and souvenirs in the gift shop. In the evening, they had dinner at an Italian restaurant and then walked on the beach under the stars. They stayed in a small hotel near the sea. On Sunday morning, they had breakfast at a café and then returned to London. They both agreed it was a perfect weekend getaway.\",\n\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"a2_text_002\",\n    title: \"Starting a New Job\",\n    level: \"A2\",\n    wordCount: 195,\n    difficulty: 2,\n    topics: [\"work\", \"office\", \"colleagues\"],\n    text: \"Emily was nervous about her first day at her new job. She works as a marketing assistant at a technology company. She arrived at the office building at 8:45 AM, fifteen minutes before her official start time. The receptionist was very friendly and directed her to the third floor. Her manager, Mr. Johnson, welcomed her warmly and introduced her to the team. There are twelve people in the marketing department. Everyone seemed nice and helpful. Mr. Johnson showed Emily to her desk, which had a new computer and all the supplies she needed. He explained that the company has flexible working hours - employees can start between 8:00 and 9:30 AM. Emily's main responsibilities include writing social media posts, organizing events, and helping with market research. During lunch break, her colleagues invited her to join them at a nearby café. They told her about the company culture and gave her useful tips about the best places to eat around the office. By the end of the day, Emily felt much more confident and excited about her new career.\",\n\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"a2_text_003\",\n    title: \"A Cooking Disaster\",\n    level: \"A2\",\n    wordCount: 210,\n    difficulty: 2,\n    topics: [\"cooking\", \"food\", \"mistakes\"],\n    text: \"Yesterday evening, Peter decided to cook a special dinner for his parents' anniversary. He planned to make roast chicken with vegetables and a chocolate cake for dessert. Peter considers himself a good cook, but he rarely makes such elaborate meals. He started cooking at 4:00 PM because his parents would arrive at 7:00 PM. First, he prepared the chicken by adding herbs and spices. He put it in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius. While the chicken was cooking, he began making the chocolate cake. Unfortunately, he accidentally used salt instead of sugar in the cake mixture. He only realized his mistake when he tasted the batter - it was horrible! There wasn't enough time to make another cake, so he quickly drove to the bakery and bought a ready-made one. When he returned home, he smelled something burning. The chicken was completely black! He had forgotten to set the timer. Panic-stricken, Peter ordered pizza instead. When his parents arrived, they found him looking very embarrassed. However, they laughed about the situation and said the pizza was delicious. They were just happy to spend time together.\",\n\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"a2_text_004\",\n    title: \"Moving to a New City\",\n    level: \"A2\",\n    wordCount: 220,\n    difficulty: 3,\n    topics: [\"moving\", \"city_life\", \"adaptation\"],\n    text: \"Six months ago, Lisa moved from a small village to Manchester, a big city in northern England. The change has been both exciting and challenging. In her village, everyone knew each other, and life was quiet and peaceful. Manchester is completely different - it's busy, noisy, and full of energy. Lisa moved because she got a job opportunity at a large hospital where she works as a nurse. At first, everything seemed overwhelming. The traffic was terrible, public transport was confusing, and she felt lost in the crowded streets. Finding an apartment was particularly difficult because rent prices were much higher than in her village. Eventually, she found a nice flat in a residential area, about twenty minutes from the city center by bus. Lisa has gradually adapted to city life. She enjoys the cultural activities - there are excellent museums, theaters, and concerts. The shopping is fantastic, with large malls and interesting independent shops. She has also made some good friends at work and joined a local gym. Although she sometimes misses the tranquility of village life, Lisa is happy with her decision. The career opportunities in the city are much better, and she feels she is growing both personally and professionally.\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"a2_text_005\",\n    title: \"A Memorable Concert\",\n    level: \"A2\",\n    wordCount: 200,\n    difficulty: 2,\n    topics: [\"music\", \"entertainment\", \"experience\"],\n    text: \"Last month, Sarah attended her first live rock concert. Her favorite band, Arctic Monkeys, was performing at the local arena. She had been waiting for this moment for years because they rarely tour in her country. Sarah bought the tickets online as soon as they went on sale, even though they were quite expensive. On the night of the concert, she arrived early to get a good position near the stage. The venue was packed with thousands of excited fans from all ages. The atmosphere was electric - everyone was singing along to the songs and dancing. The opening band was also excellent and warmed up the crowd perfectly. When Arctic Monkeys finally appeared on stage, the audience went crazy. The sound quality was amazing, and the light show was spectacular. Sarah knew all the lyrics and sang every song with enthusiasm. The band played for nearly two hours, including several of their biggest hits and some new material. During one song, the lead singer pointed directly at Sarah, which made her feel incredibly special. After the concert, she waited outside hoping to meet the band members, but they left through a private exit. Despite this small disappointment, Sarah said it was the best night of her life and she can't wait for their next tour.\",\n\n  }\n];\n\nexport default readingTextsA2;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAEA,IAAMA,cAAc,IAAAC,aAAA,GAAAC,CAAA,OAAG,CACrB;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,KAAK,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACvBC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;EACdC,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;EACbC,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,EAAE,WAAW,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC;EAC1CC,IAAI,EAAE;AAER,CAAC,EACD;EACEN,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,KAAK,EAAE,oBAAoB;EAC3BC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;EACdC,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;EACbC,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,MAAM,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,YAAY,CAAC;EACxCC,IAAI,EAAE;AAER,CAAC,EACD;EACEN,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,KAAK,EAAE,oBAAoB;EAC3BC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;EACdC,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;EACbC,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM,EAAE,UAAU,CAAC;EACvCC,IAAI,EAAE;AAER,CAAC,EACD;EACEN,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,KAAK,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAC7BC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;EACdC,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;EACbC,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,EAAE,WAAW,EAAE,YAAY,CAAC;EAC7CC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEN,EAAE,EAAE,aAAa;EACjBC,KAAK,EAAE,qBAAqB;EAC5BC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,SAAS,EAAE,GAAG;EACdC,UAAU,EAAE,CAAC;EACbC,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,EAAE,eAAe,EAAE,YAAY,CAAC;EAChDC,IAAI,EAAE;AAER,CAAC,CACF;AAED,eAAeT,cAAc","ignoreList":[]}
